__week 1 report__ <br>
**O** create the new branch (data brach) to take care of all files needed to dowload the images and modify them as necessary <br>
**O** create the data directory to keep all files needed to dowload the images and their labels (we might need to change the position of these files) <br>
**O** we did not modify the getitem method in bps_dataset file, since for our clustring model, we need the image and the label <br>
**O** we added the usefull links to the different pretrain clusteing model we found online here: <br>
      **.** Image clustering using transfer learning (https://towardsdatascience.com/image-clustering-using-transfer-learning-df5862779571) <br>
            **..** Explaining how to use kmean for our image clusteing <br>
      **.** Image Clustering Using NimbusML Pipeline (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nimbusml/tutorials/b_f-image-processing-clustering) <br>
            **..** This website contain the code for pretrain clustering model to use in our project <br>
      **.** Extract a feature vector for any image with PyTorch (https://becominghuman.ai/extract-a-feature-vector-for-any-image-with-pytorch-9717561d1d4c) <br>
            **..** Good toturial using pytorch <br>
